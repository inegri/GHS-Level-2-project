# PLNTZ
I'm a ncea level 2 student at Greymouth High School. I have previously worked on a trivia game which was made through applab and worked on making a game around the gamefroot platform. We also went on a trip to christchurch and learnt a lot about game design and did a speech about our trivia game. Our team is the distribution team. 
Me,Dylan,Finn and Yotam. Me and Dylan are doing the project of trying to find 50 different students from greyhigh school and we are going to be using Provincial Growth Fund to help fund our project and fundraising for it by doing a sausage sizzle or doing a raffle at new world or the warehouse. This could be a really good way to get money to fund our project because all it takes is time.
My group has presented in front of Brent Drummond and Ms Mortimer, This helped our group get good feedback to better our project. A good piece of advice from Brent Drummond was that if we have 50 school students instead of 100 because it will be a lot easier to trial.
The name of our project is “PLNTZ”. Our group consisting of Me,Finn,Dylan,Yotam and Emily we are working to distribute 50 plants to 50 randomly selected to greymouth high students
